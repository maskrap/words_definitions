# _Words and Definitions_

#### By **Sam Park**

## Objectives
Make an application that contains two classes: One for Word, and one for Definition. The homepage of the app should list all words, and let you click on them to view all of their definitions. A user should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:
* All previous objectives are in place (see below).
Objects are created from a custom class with custom methods.
* An instance of one class appears in the method of another class.
* Sinatra routes process GET and POST requests/responses.
* Discuss the flow of your code and the concepts behind it with an instructor using correct terminology.

Last Week's Objectives:
* Specs have complete coverage for the behaviors that need to be tested.
* All specs are passing.
* Logic is easy to understand.
* Code has proper indentation and spacing.
* Variable names are descriptive.
* Sinatra application uses views, instance variables and forms.
* Good Git documentation (regular commits with clear, consistently formatted messages and complete README).
* Message syntax should complete the sentence "This commit will..."; for example "update image files on the home page".
